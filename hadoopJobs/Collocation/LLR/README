Given the output of CollocationPartialCounts
Passing through (no map) will place word pairs next to each other
There will be entries for each pair -- one produced from the reduce bin of each word in the last step

Need the total number of word pairs -- for now just put it in the script

Given:
(A,B): A, A frequency, (A,B) frequency
(A,B): B, B frequency, (A,B) frequency

compute the Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) that 2 words occur together:

First, define the shannon entropy function, H
define k11 = (A,B) frequency -- number of times A and B occur together
define k21 = A frequency - (A,B) frequency -- frequency of A and not B
define k12 = B frequency - (A,B) frequency -- frequency of B and not A
define k22 = total pairs - (A frequency + B frequency - (A,B) frequency) -- frequency of not A and not B

then
row_entropy = H(k11, k12) + H(k21, k22)
col_entropy = H(k11, k21) + H(k12, k22)
matrix_entropy = H(k11, k12, k21, k22))

LLR = 2*(matrix_entropy - row_entropy - column_entropy)
support = (A,B) frequency

emit:
(A,B): LLR, support
