For collcation we need to find:
total number of pairs in the corpus (found by CollocationCount)
and for every combination of words that appear together, (A,B):
how often (A,B) occur together
how often A occurs but not B (equiv. how often A occurs and we know how often (A,B) occurs)
how often B occurs but not B (equiv. ")

This script finds these values so that we can use them in the next

Map:
For each tweet and each unique pair of words (A,B) emit:
A: (B, 1)
B: (A, 1)

Reduce:
Each bin gives us all pairs of words that we see with a given word.  Find total frequency of that word and the pairs of frequencies with all other words
for each pair emit, and make sure A and B in the key are sorted:
(A,B): A, frequency of A, frequency of (A,B)
