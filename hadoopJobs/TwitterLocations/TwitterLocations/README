find tweeters that we suspect are in a given city
For now assume that a person is in a city if:
i) they tweet at least 2 locations from that city
ii) they tweet from their home city > (strictly greater than) the time
    they tweet from all other cities

map: do nothing, pass through (user, city)

reduce: for each user bin look at the occurance of each city.
Only the city that occurs the most (mode) is a candidate
(if 2 cities tie neither is considered the home city so doesn't matter
which you consider)
if occurance(max city) >= 2 and occurance(max city) > occurance(all cities)/2 (rounded down/truncated)
emit (user, max city)
