Find occurances of every venue unique to a city in every tweet
inputs are:
tweets as ('tweet', user id, canonical tweet text)
venues as ('venue', name, city)

map:
if a tweet emit, for every unique word in the tweet (remove dups)
(key: word, val: ('tweet', user, canonical tweet text)
if a venue emit, for only the _first_ word of the venue
(key: word, val: ('venue', name, city)

at the reduce stage all true matches between a tweet and a venue will be
located in the same word bucket (a word at the start of the venue and that
appears in the tweet)

no need to dedup: we must match in the bin for the first word of the venue,
and a matching tweet only emitted that word once since we deduped

reduce:
for each word (ignore what the word actually is)
compare every venue against every tweet in the bucket.
If the venue name is located within the tweet emit:
(twitter user, city)
