given clean tweets (id, tweet text, user id, user handle)
where each whitespace in the tweet text is a single space

produce lines of ('tweet', user id, canonical tweet text)
only using a mapper
canonical text contains only alphanumeric words, all lowercase, and single space whitespace.  (no punctuation, upper case, or special characters)

we need this to match against foursquare venues
